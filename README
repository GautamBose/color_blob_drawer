How to use the program
________________________________________________________________________________
Ensure yout webcam is plugged, then launch the program in a terminal.
It will create two windows: the filter window and the drawing window.

* 1-Setting up the filter window

Select the color of the object using the sliders in the filter window.
The color filter is made of three components:
* a Hue component
* a Saturation component
* a Value component
For more information about what these components mean, check Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV
The white pixels correspond to the pixels that pass the current HSV filter.
You should adjust the sliders until only the object to track is marked in white.

* 1-Using the drawing window

Once the filter is set up, you can use the drawing window.
Move your object around to draw in the drawing window.
Hide it for a few seconds to clear the drawing.
